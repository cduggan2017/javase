/*Working with Files

Create an array list and populate it with 5 of these objects (Make up the values
etc.)

Create a loop to iterate through the ArrayList, writing each object to one file
(Think about how you format this)

Separately, create another ArrayList and populate it with the data in the file
you just wrote too. (Youâ€™re going to have to parse it back In the format you
wrote it in)
